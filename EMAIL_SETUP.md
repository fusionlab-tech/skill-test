# Email Setup Guide for Skill Test Platform

## Problem Solved
The previous email functionality using `mailto:` links was unreliable and often didn't work. This has been replaced with a robust EmailJS solution that provides:

- ✅ Reliable email delivery
- ✅ Professional email templates
- ✅ Fallback options if EmailJS fails
- ✅ User feedback and error handling

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Configure Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to "Email Services"
2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the authentication steps
5. Note down your **Service ID** 

### 3. Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Design your email template using these variables:
   ```
   {{candidate_name}} - Candidate's full name
   {{candidate_email}} - Candidate's email address
   {{candidate_address}} - Candidate's full address
   {{candidate_phone}} - Candidate's phone number
   {{skill_tested}} - Skill being tested
   {{score}} - Exam score (e.g., "8/10")
   {{percentage}} - Percentage score (e.g., "80%")
   {{time_remaining}} - Time left when exam was submitted
   {{question_details}} - Detailed question-by-question results
   ```
4. Note down your **Template ID** 

### 4. Get Public Key
1. Go to "Account" → "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Public Key** 

### 5. Update Configuration
1. Open `email-utility.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   ```javascript
   const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
       PUBLIC_KEY: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY",
       SERVICE_ID: "YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID", 
       TEMPLATE_ID: "YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID"
   };
   ```

## How It Works

### Primary Method: EmailJS
- Sends professional emails using your configured service
- Uses customizable email templates
- Provides delivery confirmation
- Handles errors gracefully

### Fallback Method: Mailto
- If EmailJS fails, falls back to opening user's email client
- Pre-fills email with exam results
- Ensures results are never lost

### User Experience
- Users see clear feedback about email status
- If email fails, users get the results to copy manually
- Multiple fallback options ensure reliability

## Testing

1. Complete a skill test
2. Submit the exam
3. Check your email for results
4. Verify all candidate information is included
5. Test fallback functionality by temporarily using wrong credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
- Verify EmailJS credentials are correct
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure EmailJS service is active
- Check email service authentication

### Fallback Not Working
- Verify `mailto:` links work in your browser
- Check if default email client is configured
- Test with different browsers

### Template Issues
- Verify template variables match the code
- Check template syntax in EmailJS dashboard
- Test template with sample data

## Security Notes

- EmailJS public key is safe to expose in client-side code
- Service ID and template ID are also public
- No sensitive credentials are stored in the code
- All email content is sent through EmailJS's secure service

## Cost

- EmailJS free tier: 200 emails/month
- Paid plans start at $15/month for 1,000 emails
- Suitable for small to medium skill testing operations
